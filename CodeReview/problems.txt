Problems:
- Security Vulnerabilities:
    1. there is no validation for the username, email and password fields.
    2. the password needs to be hashed in a better way than make password that create user used.
    3. there is no csrf token check.
- Performance Issues:
    1. there is no check for the username or email already exists or not, which could result in unnecessary database queries or unique constraint violations.
- Maintainability Issues:
    1. there is no error handling.
    2. there is no proper response for the error.
    3. there is no proper response for the success and create user. 
    4. there is no form or serializer to handle the data.
